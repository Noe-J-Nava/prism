# Processing IMPLAN data for county output and employment across all U.S. industries to be used by DSI economics team

This repository reflects the working directory to process and clean IMPLAN data. However, the raw data must be requested from [No√© J Nava](mailto:noejn2@illinois). Then, raw data is to be placed in `data/`. The `output/dsi_econ` includes the processed data using the codes in `code/`. `output/dsi_econ` is also empty.
